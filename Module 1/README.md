# Overview
Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that stands at the crossing of engineering, artificial intelligence, control theory, cognitive science, and philosophy. For decades, robotic systems have been applied in industrial settings, but only recently have robots started to find their way into our daily lives. For example, small household robots like automatic vacuum cleaners are commonplace, and self-driving cars are on the brink of entering public roads. The high scientific and economic significance of robotics makes it a very active research field, with the community constantly developing new ideas and technologies. And as large the application domain of robots is, so is the number of proposed robot designs and algorithms.

## Learning Objectives

In this learning module, you should obtain an overview of the field of mobile robotics. In particular, you will learn about different types of mobile robots, what their application areas are, how they are helpful to society, and also about their limitations. In the process, you will also learn about the main hardware and software components of a mobile robot.

## Readings

You are encouraged to do some online research to gain a deeper overview of robotics and specifically mobile robots. To that end, we suggest several online reading resources that can serve as a starting point for you. However, you can also do your own search and use any resources that you like.

## Assignment

For this assignment, you need to search online and find a video that demonstrates an important or interesting application of a mobile robot. You must then justify your choice in a short text and briefly describe the technical aspects of the robot. You can use the Shakey the Robot video and the corresponding description as an inspiration. Next, please share your text and video with other students on the discussion board and comment on the videos of others. You can find more information on the assignment page.

After this learning unit, you should be able to:

describe several types of (mobile) robots.
provide a list of applications, in which mobile robots are useful.
present a number of challenges in the field of mobile robotics.
list approaches that are commonly used to overcome these problems.


## To Do List

In order to successfully complete Module 1, please do the following:

Read: Inform yourself about the history of robotics, different types of robots, and common problems and solutions by either using the provided resources or doing your own online research. (approximated time: 3 hours)
Demonstrate: Find an online video that demonstrates an important or interesting use case of mobile robotics. Write a short text about the clip, and share the video and text with other students. See the assignment page for further instructions. (approximated time: 3 hours)
Discuss: Watch the videos posted by other students, and comment your thoughts on the video you liked the most. (approximated time: 2 hours)
