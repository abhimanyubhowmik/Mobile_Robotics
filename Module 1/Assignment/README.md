# Start Assignment: Who are We?

In online learning environments, it is important to get to know each other - that means building a community. One first step is therefore to introduce yourself and also to watch the other students' short videos.

Please create a 1-2 minutes video and upload it here.

Introduce yourself by answering the following questions:

1. Name
2. What study program are you currently participating in?
3. What do you want to learn in this course?
4. Anything else, something funny or just what you want to share with us?

The due date for this activity is Saturday. Please listen to the other stories and say Hi to the others, that means reply to 2-3 other students, preferably to those who haven't received any Welcome Greetings yet.

# Individual Assignment: Robot Video

Find an online video that showcases a mobile robot in action and write a short text about it. In the text, you need to describe the type of the robot, its main task and why that task is relevant. For instance, how could that robot potentially improve human life? Further, identify one major difficulty that the robot might face to reach its goal, i.e., why is the task non-trivial? or what are the safety concerns? Finally, briefly outline what method or technology was deployed to overcome that obstacle, or, if that is not clear from the video, name a state-of-the-art solution for the problem. You can take the description of the Shakey video as inspiration. Try not to pick the most obvious videos, you will be given an extra point for originality!

As the final part of the assignment, please post the link to your video and your text on the discussion board. Then, look at the videos and texts of other participants. Choose one of the videos posted by your fellow students that seem most interesting to you. Explain in a few sentences what you find interesting about it and why.
